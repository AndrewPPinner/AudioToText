    betting for tomorrow's word is open from noon today until 9am tomorrow
        do this logic in java
            Date betDay = timestamp.today at 9:00 am (before 9 am is still considered yesterday)

            -check if word is set for (betDay)
                *if word is not set, don't allow bets to be made
            -word is set for (betDay)
                -create/update (betday)
