# AudioToText

This was a project develop during my time at Tech Elevator with a close friend of mine, Nick. The idea of the project was, Nick or I would 
set a word or phrase that we expected would be said numerous times in the following days lecture and our Cohort mates would guess how many times it would be said.
<br/>
We calculated this by processing the live audio from our lectures into a Word doc that would then after lecture be screened for the word or phrase and then would update
the database of the count and query the guesses of our class mates. The person nearest to the bet would then be displayed on the main screen for everyone to see. We also
displayed the number of times each user had one as well as created a leaderboard.
<br/>
The live site is no longer used as we have all graduated but it is still hosted on a local server of mine frozen in time of one of our last lectures.
